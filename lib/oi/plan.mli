(** Build plan: dependency graph of package actions, and the fully-resolved
    execution plan derived from it.

    Two-stage:
    - {!build} returns a {!graph} (the action DAG with [method_] / layer hashes
      decided per package). This is the structural plan suitable for dry-run
      output, parallel-group inspection, and layer-cache lookups.
    - {!resolve} expands a {!graph} into a {!t} with all opam variables,
      filters, and commands turned into concrete shell commands grouped by stage
      — what {!Execute.run} consumes.

    Build directories are deterministic under the oi cache root at
    [{cache_root}/build/_build/{pkg}-{short_hash}/], with the shared prefix at
    [{cache_root}/build/prefix/]. Each package lists the dependency layers that
    must be hardlinked into the prefix before building. *)

(** {1 Action graph}

    Captures the full dependency DAG with per-package build phases, preserving
    the parallel structure from the solver. When [~d10] is provided to {!build},
    packages whose layers already exist in the cache are marked as {!Binary} and
    restored directly instead of being built from source. *)
